A bicycle for the mind.

Set your OpenAI key in the [.env] file, then open the [JupyterCopilot.ipynb] notebook.

The notebook shows how to create a '%ai' jupyter magic to fill a new cell with a copilot suggestion.
The nice thing about jupyter is that you can play with 'magics' inside the notebook itself, you don't need any server trick.

More to come...
