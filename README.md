Set your OpenAI key in the [.env](.env) file, then open the [JupyterCopilot.ipynb](JupyterCopilot.ipynb) notebook.

The notebook shows how to create a `%ai` **jupyter magic** to fill a new cell with a copilot suggestion.

The nice thing about jupyter is that you can play with 'magics' inside the notebook itself, you don't need any server javascript trick.

More to come...
